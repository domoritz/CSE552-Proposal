# CSE552-Proposal

Project proposal for course CSE 552


## Background

* Query plans are executed in a distributed db. This makes it difficult to understand. 
* Executions could be blocked because a node doesn't deliver.

## Objective


## Question we want to answer with our visualization

* Why is an execution blocked?
* What are the dependencies?
* What is the bottleneck?
* Which nodes are wrking at what times (not concrete)?
